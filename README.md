# HRequest - Winamp Request Plugin

HRequest is a Winamp General Plugin that allows requesting songs through a website.

If you require remote controls or wish to let friends choose what they would like to listen then this is for you.

This project is very old, but due to a recent request I decided to publish the source code before it gets lost forever. It was rewritten from scratch, the old version had a blue interface.

## Installation Instructions:

Copy the `gen_hrequest.dll` file [download here](https://github.com/Henry00IS/HRequest/raw/master/build/gen_hrequest.dll) into `C:\Program Files (x86)\Winamp\Plugins`.

By default the website is accessible at http://127.0.0.1:8080/ and can be changed using the `HRequestConfig.exe` [download here](https://github.com/Henry00IS/HRequest/raw/master/build/HRequestConfig.exe) program.

## Usage Instructions:

When you start Winamp you will eventually hear a loud beep, the website can now be opened.

Song requests will also be confirmed with a beep.

Changing the playlist requires a restart of Winamp.
